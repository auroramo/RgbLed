# Controlling the RGB Led intensities in RPI2 with IoT Core and the PWM library

A Windows IoT Core RBG Led sample using the [PWM library](https://github.com/ms-iot/BusProviders/tree/develop/PWM)

> Draft: Not yet finished, will have a complete working sample in a couple of days.

## The RGB values
For controlling the intensity of the RGB values in the GPIO pins, a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is needed.
We can use a PWM circuit for it or simulate it via software.

For this example we will use the software modulation found in the [PWM library](https://github.com/ms-iot/BusProviders/tree/develop/PWM)

## Wiring
Experimenting right now with the wiring like here:
